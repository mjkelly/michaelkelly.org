Hi! I'm Michael Kelly, a software engineer in New York, NY.

You can email me at [m@michaelkelly.org](mailto:m@michaelkelly.org). (You can
use my [GPG key](assets/m-at-michaelkelly-dot-org-gpg.txt) if you want.)

Here's my [resume](assets/michael-kelly-resume-jul-2022.pdf).

I occasionally put things on [GitHub](https://github.com/mjkelly).

I have a [blog](https://blog.michaelkelly.org) which is not frequently updated.

I'm also on <a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@mkelly">Mastodon</a>
though I haven't figured out what to do with it yet.
