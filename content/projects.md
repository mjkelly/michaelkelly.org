Some of these are quite old!

- [Weatherdash](https://github.com/mjkelly/weatherdash):
  A self-hosted weather dashboard designed for small screens.

- [nato-alpha](https://nato-alpha.michaelkelly.org/):
  Simple phonetic alphabet translator, made in an evening to try out some
  simple vue.js. Translates "abc" to "alpha bravo charlie", etc.

- [Marry-Fuck-Kill](http://marryfuckkill.com):
  Web version of the parlor game, with user-made content. Collaboration with
  [Hunter Freyer](http://www.hjfreyer.com/). <b>Beware</b>, all content is
  user-submitted, a lot is distateful and NSFW because it's the internet. Ask
  me what I learned about the challenges of content moderation sometime.

- [CampusMap](http://campusmap.michaelkelly.org):
  An interactive map of the UC San Diego campus. Collaboration with David
  Lindquist.

- [experiments](https://github.com/mjkelly/experiments):
  This is a GitHub repo I keep with all experimental things that aren't
  large or involved enough to warrant their own repo.
